            my favourite sport man is leechong wei he is an amazing badminton player and former chammpion in malaysia.
            i like his smash.
            my favourite anime characther is boruto,naruto,goku,vegeta and my favourite animated charachter is po from kungfu panda
            my most favourite boruto:
            boruto is a ninja who aims to be a shinobi but his father naruto the 7th hokage,and his grandfather is 4th hokage
            (hokage is the highest position in ninja if somebody want to become a hokage they want to put their life in line to save their village from their enemy)as his father and grandfather are hokage he want to be different so he choosed shinobi and get trained from sasuke (sasuke is the best friend of naruto)because sasuke is the best shinobi in their village(shinobi is like a secret agent who will be the right hand of hokage if somebody wnat to be a shinboi they want to use weapons perfectly and their speed should be in an amazing height,and they want to have a specific ninja style and they have really sharp sword )
